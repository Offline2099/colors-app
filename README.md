# Color Converter

## Project Description

An easy-to-use color converter. Can also be thought of as a demonstration for explaining color spaces (RGB, HSL, and CMYK). Includes multiple input notations for each color space. Can be used as a color picker.

* Allows multiple ways to input the color: with sliders for any of the three color spaces, or as text in multiple notations (such as arithmetic, percentages, hexadecimal).
    
* Automatically outputs the color converted to all three color spaces (RGB, HSL, CMYK) in all the most commonly used notations.
    
* Provides an interactive visual demonstration of how changing a color in one format affects the representation of that color in other formats.
    
* Includes complex step-by-step validation for text input (which uses regular expressions). Shows exactly what is wrong in case of an error. Provides warnings for valid but odd input.
    
* Contains a separate tab with a brief summary of how the human eye recognizes and distinguishes colors, along with a simple explanation of how color spaces are constructed.
    
* Can possibly be upgraded to work with more rare and exotic color spaces or color notations.
